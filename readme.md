Hello Mitchell!

I was not sure if  we were able to use bootstrap and other style sheets for our project. So I have created two portfolios. 

Portfolio2.html is the non bootstrap version. It is used with styles2.css

Portfolio_bootstrap is the portfolio utilizing bootstrap and imported style sheets.

I completely expect you to only grade one of these portfolios, however I felt I should upload both. Thank you so much!
